# Contributing to Our Project

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Gerrit

We use Gerrit for code review. You can propose changes by submitting a patch to Gerrit.

## We Use [Coding Conventions](#)

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, please follow these coding conventions.

## Report bugs using Storyboard

We use [Storyboard](https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/project/volvocars/powertrain-build) issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

A bug report with an isolated way to reproduce the problem is ideal. Here's an example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the environment in which it occurs. If suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> `<a link to the reduced test case>`
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being reported.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

We are using a specific coding style. Please follow it to make the codebase easier to read and maintain.
